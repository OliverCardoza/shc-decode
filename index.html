        </summary>
        <p>
          I recently started working at <a href="https://verily.com/">Verily</a>, which is a sister
          company to Google, that focuses on healthcare and life sciences. I've been learning
          about the tech used to generate the COVID QR codes including the
          <a href="https://hl7.org/FHIR/">FHIR</a>  data format, and the
          <a href="https://smarthealthit.org/">SMART</a> app framework. When I received my
          vaccination QR code it seemed like a perfect opportunity to dive in.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first I found a few Python examples (
          <a href="https://github.com/tahnok/ont_shc_decode/">[1]</a>,
          <a href="https://marcan2020.medium.com/reversing-smart-health-cards-e765157fae9">[2]</a>).
          but I didn't want to go through the hassle of setting up a Python workspace.
          Then I found
          <a href="https://fproulx.github.io/shc-covid19-decoder/">shc-covid19-decoder</a>
          but it didn't work for me. I couldn't stop thinking about it so I decided to make my own.
          In the end, I found it a great learning experience as I dove into the quirks of JWTs,
          base64 encoding, and zlib compression used by SMART Health Cards.
